  - the following `R` packages: `usethis`, `gitcreds`, `groundhog`
  
```{r install-pkg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

packages = c("usethis", "gitcreds", "groundhog")

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
```

- A recent version of [*RStudio*](https://posit.co/downloads/)

## Workshop Structure & Materials

- The workshop consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises

- Slides and other materials are available at

https://github.com/jobreu/reproducible-research-gesis-2023

- The workshop repository on the [*GESIS ILIAS*](https://ilias.gesis.org) contains some literature on tools and workflows for reproducibility as well as a timetable for this workshop

---

## Online format

- If possible, we invite you to turn on your camera

- Feel free to ask questions anytime

  - If you have an immediate question during the lecture parts, please send it via text chat, publicly or privately (ideally to a person who is currently not presenting)

  - If you have a question that is not urgent and might be interesting for everybody, you can also use audio (& video) to ask it at the end of a lecture part or during the exercises
(please use the use the "raise hand" function in *Zoom* for this)

- We would kindly ask you to mute your microphones when you are not asking (or answering) a question

## Disclaimer

We will cover several different tools that can be used for reproducible research in the quantitative social sciences. We will only be able to cover the basics of those tools, so if you want to continue to use them and use them in more advanced ways, you will probably need to "dig deeper" eventually and consult further resources (documentation, further tutorials, blog posts, or other publications).

---

## Disclaimer

As you probably already know, there are a lot of different tools and workflows that can be employed for increasing the reproducibility of research. We will introduce you to some of those, but there is more, and, in the end, it depends on your personal preferences and needs what tools and workflows you employ.<sup>1</sup>

In this course, we will focus on reproducible research using `R`. However, there also are solutions for reproducible research with other programming languages, such as `Python` or `Julia`, as well as statistical software packages, such as *SPSS*  and *Stata*.

## Defining reproducibility

> A minimum standard on a spectrum of activities (“reproducibility spectrum”) for assessing the value or accuracy of scientific claims .highlight[based on the original methods, data, and code] [...] In some fields, this meaning is, instead, associated with the term “replicability” or ‘repeatability’ ([FORRT Glossary - Reproducibility](https://forrt.org/glossary/reproducibility/))

## Defining dimensions

## Computational reproducibility

There also are distinctions between different types (or components) of reproducibility. One type/component that is especially relevant for this workshop is "Computational reproducibility":

> Ability to .highlight[recreate the same results as the original study] (including tables, figures, and quantitative findings), .highlight[using the same input data, computational methods, and conditions of analysis]. The availability of code and data facilitates computational reproducibility, as does preparation of these materials (annotating data, delineating software versions used, sharing computational environments, etc). Ideally, computational reproducibility should be achievable by another second researcher (or the original researcher, at a future time), using only a set of files and written instructions ([FORRT Glossary - Computational reproducibility](https://forrt.org/glossary/computational-reproducibility/))

---

## Reproducibility as a continuum

## Tools & workflows `r ji("hammer and wrench")` `r ji("clipboard")`

In our case, **tools** are programming languages, programs, and other pieces of software that we can use to make our research (more easily) reproducible.

**Workflows** are the ways in which we combine these tools to achieve our goal.

---

## Tools & workflows `r ji("hammer and wrench")` `r ji("clipboard")`

Choosing tools and establishing worklflows are somewhat idiosyncratic processes that depend on...

  - the requirements of your project (methods, data types...)
  
  - the availability of tools
  
  - your skills and knowledge
  
  - the preferences of collaborators
  
  ...

## Reproducible research workflows

> being an open scientist means .highlight[adopting a few straightforward research management practices, which lead to less error-prone, reproducible research workflows] ([Klein et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.158), p. 11)

---

## Research management practices

There are quite a few practices that researchers can adopt to increase the reproducibility of their work.

- Using free and open source software (FOSS)
- [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)
- [Clear folder structures](https://psych-transparency-guide.uni-koeln.de/folder-structure.html)
- [Naming things](https://betterprogramming.pub/string-case-styles-camel-pascal-snake-and-kebab-case-981407998841?gi=3295916e039)
- ...

Notably, all of those practices as well as the use of the tools we cover in this workshop require a certain degree of **Computer literacy**.
