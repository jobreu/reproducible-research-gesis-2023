## Dependencies in `R`

Most `R` packages depend on other `R` packages. 

All `R` packages depend on `R`.

--

Both `R` and `R` packages have versions.

Different versions of `R` packages may depend on different versions of `R` and different versions of other packages.

---

## Dependencies in `R`

```{r dep-graph, out.width = "70%", echo = F}
# plot_dependency_graph("C:/Users/breuerjs/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/usethis")
plot_dependency_graph(file.path(.libPaths()[1], "usethis"))
```

`r ji("turtle")`

--

... or is it???

---

## Digging `r ji("pick")` into your tool stack `r ji("hammer and wrench")`

Your full `R` setup consists of:

1. Specific versions of `R` packages<sup>1</sup>
2. A specific version of `R`<sup>2</sup>
3. A specific version of your operating system
4. Specific hardware

.small[
[1] You can have different libraries with different (versions of) `R` packages.

[2] You can also have different versions of `R` installed on your machine.

## Further dependencies

```{r stack, continuum, out.width = "30%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("toppling-tower.jpg")
```

<small><small>*Note*: We could also add system libraries between `R` and the OS (which are especially relevant in the [Linux/Unix world](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)).</small></small>

## What to "ship" `r ji("ship")`?

- `R` code (+ underlying data)
  - this should include information about the packages used
  
- information about the version of `R` and the used packages

--

- your whole computational environment (focus of the next session)

- overall goal: preventing what is known as "code rot" & "works-on-my-machine errors" (WOMME)

---

## Dependency management solutions

As with almost everything in the `R` ecosystem, there are multiple solutions for dependency management:

- a manual approach
- [~~`checkpoint`~~](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint)<sup>1</sup>
- [**`groundhog`**](https://groundhogr.com/)
- [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)<sup>2</sup>
- [`rang`](https://github.com/gesistsa/rang)<sup>3</sup>

]

---

## Manual approach to dependency management

There is an easy-to-use manual solution for providing information about the packages and `R` version used in your project:

.small[
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
]

---

## Manual approach to dependency management

You can, e.g., provide the output of `sessionInfo()` in a `.txt` file. We have created a short `R` script which does that. You can find the `session_info_to_txt.R` script in the folder `content/R/` within the workshop materials.
An exemplary output of that `session_info.txt` can be found in the root directory of the workshop materials.

---

## `groundhog`  

[`groundhog`](https://groundhogr.com/) is a lightweight package that allows you to increase the reproducibility of your `R` scripts. It does so by installing and loading "packages & their dependencies as available on chosen date on CRAN".

---

## Using `groundhog`

All you need to do to use `groundhog` is specifying the packages you want to use in your script and a date.

```{r groundhog-ex, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("groundhog")
library(groundhog)

pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "janitor", "sjPlot")

groundhog.library(pkgs, date = "2023-11-17")
```

---

## How `groundhog` works

From the [package website](https://groundhogr.com/back-end/): "groundhog relies on a database that contains virtually all package versions ever uploaded to CRAN, the date when they were published, and all dependencies."

`groundhog` also used to rely on MRAN. Since that has been retired, however, it now uses its own package repository: [GRAN: Groundhog R Archive Neighbor](https://groundhogr.com/gran/). 

---

## How `groundhog` works

`groundhog` uses its own package library to install the packages you specified. From the documentation of the `restore.library()` function: "When groundhog installs a package, it installs it into groundhog's library."

```{r groundhog-lib}
library(groundhog)
get.groundhog.folder()
```

"Groundhog then immediately moves the installed package(s) (and their dependencies) to the default personal library."

```{r default-lib}
.libPaths()[1]
```

.small[
*Note*: You can find a lot more technical information on the [`groundhog` website](https://groundhogr.com/) and within the help files for the `groundhog` functions.
]

---

## Reversing changes made by `groundhog`

You can reverse the changes made by `groundhog` to your default personal `R` package library:

```{r restore-lib, eval = FALSE}
restore.library()
```
---

## Pros and cons of `groundhog`

*Pros:*
- can be easily used to make existing `R` scripts more reproducible
- does not require a "project-based workflow"<sup>1</sup>
- does not require any specific knowledge on the reproducer's side

*Cons:*
- works with package snapshots from specific dates, not with specific package versions
  - in reality, our installed packages are very often not up-to-date
- installs specific package versions, but not specific versions of `R`

.small[
[1] While you as someone who highly values reproducibility, of course, do use a project-based workflow, the people who want to reproduce your analysis might not `r ji("winking face")`
]

---

## Choosing a date

The recommendation by the `groundhog` package authors for choosing a date is that "a good default is the first day of the month when starting your project". Once you have added `groundhog.library()` to your script, re-run it to make sure it produces the expected results.

You can also update all of the packages you use and then specify the current date as the date for `groundhog.library()`.

---

## `groundhog` and `R` versions

The `groundhog` database also includes information on base `R` releases. As `groundhog` does not install specific versions of `R`, you should still specify the version of `R` you used in your script.

```{r r-ver}
R.version.string
```

You can find the release dates for all versions of R via the [CRAN archive page](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/).

---

## Excursus: Updating `R`

As you probably know, you can download the most recent version of `R` from the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can download older versions of `R` via the CRAN archive packages for [*Windows*](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/) and [*Mac OS X*](https://cran-archive.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).<sup>1</sup>

.small[
[1] How you install and update `R` on Linux depends on your [distribution](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/).
]

---

## Excursus: Updating `R`

On Windows, you can also use the [`installr` package](https://talgalili.github.io/installr/) to update `R`.<sup>1</sup>

```{r installr, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)

updateR()
```

.small[
[1] The `installr` package also offers some interesting other functionalities, such as installing `Git` via the `install.git()` function.
]

---

## Excursus: Updating packages

The easiest way of updating packages is simply using `install.packages()`. To update all packages or a specific set of packages, you can use the `update.packages()` function.

```{r update-pkgs, eval = FALSE}
# update all installed packages
update.packages()

# update specific packages
update.packages(oldPkgs = c("tidyverse", "janitor", "sjPlot"))

```
---

## Excursus: Updating packages

With the following code, you can detach and update all of the packages you have currently loaded in your `R` session (excluding core `R` packages):

```{r update-loaded, eval = FALSE}
loaded_pkgs <- search()
loaded_pkgs <- loaded_pkgs[grep("^package:", loaded_pkgs)]

exclude_pkgs <- c("package:base", "package:stats", "package:graphics", "package:grDevices",
                  "package:utils", "package:datasets", "package:methods", "package:utils")
loaded_pkgs <- loaded_pkgs[!loaded_pkgs %in% exclude_pkgs]

for (pkg in loaded_pkgs) {
  detach(pkg, character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
}

update_pkgs <- gsub("^package:", "", loaded_pkgs)

install.packages(update_pkgs)

```

---

## Excursus: Updating packages

If you want to install a specific version of a package (not the most recent one), the easiest option is to use a function from the `remotes` package.

```{r pkg-ver, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)

install_version("tidyverse", version = "1.3.0")

```

# More comprehensive dependency management options in `R`

---


## `renv` and its advantages<br> compared to `groundhog`

Let's talk about another option: `renv`

- `renv` is integrated with *RStudio*

- `renv` is developed by professional software engineers (rather than academic researchers)

- `renv` works with more repositories than `groundhog` 

For more information on `groundhog` vs. `renv`, see: https://groundhogr.com/renv/

---



## What is `renv`?

The package `renv` helps to create reproducible environments for *R projects*

---



## What is an `R` project?

> "R experts keep all the files associated with a project together — input data, 
> R scripts, analytical results, figures. This is such a wise and common 
> practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects." 

.small[Source: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html]

---



## Why?

Use `renv` to make your `R` projects more isolated, portable and reproducible.

- Isolated: Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break 
your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because `renv` gives each project its 
own private library.

- Portable: Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even 
across different platforms. `renv` makes it easy to install the packages your 
project depends on.

- Reproducible: `renv` records the exact package versions you depend on, and 
ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

.small[Source: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/]

---



## Let's talk about libraries<br> (and packages)

- When talking about a "reproducible R environment", this mostly (excluding `R` 
itself) refers to all the R packages that are being used

- Most of us have *one* "system library" for `R` packages, where all installed 
packages can be found (for example: `D:/Programme/R/library`)

- "The directories in `R` where the packages are stored are called the libraries" [1] 


.small[[1] https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/04_introR_packages.html]

---


## Is one R system library a good idea?

However, having *one* central system library for `R` packages may be a bad idea, 
especially when things break -- and things will break! ("dependency hell")

```{r xkcd-dep2, out.width = "38%" ,echo = F}
include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png")
```

<small><small>https://xkcd.com/2347/</small></small>

---



## renv offers "project libraries"

- Instead of using *one* central system library for all installed `R` packages, 
`renv` sets up a "project library", i.e., each `R` project has its own library

- Project libraries means that each project has its own independent 
collection of `R` packages, i.e., multiple projects can have the same `R` package 
but, e.g., different versions of it

---



## Where all the `R` packages<br> grow... repositories

- The usual ways to install an `R` package is to download the package from an 
repository

- Most famous is CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (other sources 
include Bioconductor or GitHub)

- I am currently using:

```{r}
getOption("repos")
```

---



## `renv` and repositories

- `renv` creates an `R` project-related library and installs packages into that 
specific library

- Hence, it needs to know where (a) package(s) can be found; not all packages
can be found on CRAN

---




## How does `renv` work?

- It is assumed that your work is based on the model of an "`R` project" 
(in *RStudio*)

- Similar to `Git`, you first have to initialize your `R` project, letting `renv` 
know that it should take care of all things that are related to a reproducible 
`R` environment

- At some moment in time, when everything is working fine, and you want to 
preserve this state of your `R` project, you can take an `R`-related "snapshot" of 
your project

- This snapshot can be shared with others or your future self, guaranteeing that 
you can always restore this moment in time when everything in your `R` project was 
working well (meaning: in terms of a "reproducible `R` environment")

## Workflow in `renv`

```{r renvimg, out.width = "100%" ,echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./bw/fig_renv.png")
```

---


## `renv::init()`

- `renv::init()` is run once and adds a few new directories and files to your `R` 
project

- `renv/library`: This directory is the project library that contains all 
packages currently used by your project

- `renv.lock`: Records metadata about every package ensuring that it can be 
re-installed on a new machine

- `.Rprofile`: Runs automatically every time you start `R` (**in that project 
folder**), renv uses this file to configure your `R` session to use the project 
library

.small[Source: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#getting-started]

---


## `renv` in *RStudio*

```{r renv-rstudio, out.width = "75%" ,echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("./bw/fig_renv-rstudio.png")
```

---

## `renv::snapshot()` and `renv::restore()`

- Running `renv::snapshot()` updates `renv.lock` and documents the current
collection (and their specific versions) of `R` packages that are being used in 
your `R` project

- To share an `R` project, you need to provide access to `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, 
`renv/settings.json` and `renv/activate.R` -- or, from a Git perspective, that's 
all you need to commit into your `Git` repository[1]

- Next, using `renv::restore()` a collaborator can exactly reproduce (download 
and install specific `R` packages) your `R` environment

.smaller[[1] Conveniently, the initial `renv::init()` run also creates a 
`.gitignore` file in the `renv` folder excluding everything that does not need
to go into the `Git` repository]

---


## Installing additional `R` packages

Use `install.packages()` or `renv::install()`

---


## Updating `R` packages in your `R` project

Use `renv::update()`...
