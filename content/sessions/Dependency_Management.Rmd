## Dependencies in `R`

Most `R` packages depend on other `R` packages. 

All `R` packages depend on `R`.

--

Both `R` and `R` packages have versions.

Different versions of `R` packages may depend on different versions of `R` and different versions of other packages.

---

## Dependencies in `R`

```{r, dep-graph, out.width = "70%", echo = F}
plot_dependency_graph("C:/Users/breuerjs/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3/usethis")
```

---

## Dependencies in `R`

```{r, cran-dep, out.width = "150%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("cran_usethis.png")
```
<small><small>Source: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usethis/index.html</small></small>

---

## Further dependencies

```{r, continuum, out.width = "30%", echo = F}
woRkshoptools::include_picture("toppling-tower.jpg")
```

<small><small>*Note*: We could also add system libraries between `R` and the OS (which are especially relevant in the [Linux/Unix world](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)).</small></small>

---

## The danger of dependencies

```{r, xkcd-dep, out.width = "50%" ,echo = F}
include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png")
```

## What to "ship"?

- `R` code (+ underlying data)
  - this should include information about the packages used
  
- information about the version of `R` and the used packages
  - ideally, plus files that help to recreate this setup

--

- your computational environment (focus of the next session)

- overall goal: Preventing what is known as "code rot"

---

## Documenting packages & versions

There is an easy-to-use manual solution for providing information about the packages and `R` version used in your project:

```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
